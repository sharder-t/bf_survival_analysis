# Investigating Time to Wean
## New York University, Applied Survival Analysis
### Final Project

Data were obtained froma research study on breastfeeding. Various factors associated with breastfeeding were explored in order to which predictors have the greatest impact on how long it takes a given mother to wean their child. Appropriate assumptions were investigated and the distribution of the data was confirmed to be exponential. Using applied survival analysis techniques employed in R, certain predictors  were most informative of the time to wean including the age of the mother, mother's smoking status, and the mother being of "other" race i.e. not white nor black.
